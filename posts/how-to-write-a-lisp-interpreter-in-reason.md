A while ago, Peter Norvig wrote the article [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) which does a good job of showing how to build a Lisp interpreter in Python. I'm going to show how one might build the same thing using [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/). Reason is a new statically-typed functional programming language from Facebook. Reason basically a more familiar syntax for [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and can be compiled to both Javascript and also very fast native code.
